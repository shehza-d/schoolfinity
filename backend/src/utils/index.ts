    question: "How can we push code to github?",
    answer:
      "If you have source code stored locally on your computer that is tracked by Git or not tracked by any version control system (VCS), you can add the code to GitHub by typing commands in a terminal. You can do this by typing Git commands directly, or by using GitHub CLI.",
